User Stories

  This document describes the set of user stories as well as the
roles users have when using the Smart Reservation System (SRS).

* 1. Roles

  <<Admin:>> The administrator manages buildings, reservations, equipment, users, etc. He is responsible for the
  integrity of the system.

  <<User:>> Can reserve rooms depending on the rights the user has. A user can have different rights,
  for instance a professor has a bigger pool of options than a student may have.

  <<Non-registered User:>> Can view reservations, with limitations though. He can also register a new account but has to
  wait for the admin's approval. He may also view the reservation prices.
