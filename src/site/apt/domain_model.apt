Domain Model

    This document describes the domain model ("Fachmodell") of the Smart Reservation
    System (SRS). It introduces the most important entities ("Fachklassen") and the
    associations among them. It also introduces the respective multiplicities.

    This is the domain model of our room reservation-system project.
    It describes that we can book a room on a given day and time.
    The rooms are located in a buildingImpl and contain selected equipment.
    We have different roles which are used to either maintain the system or use it.

    Note that only a few attributes are showed in the diagram, but no operations.
